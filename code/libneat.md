title: 'NEAT Library'
desc: 'The NEAT project wants to achieve a complete redesign of the way in which Internet applications interact with the network. The goal is to allow network “services” offered to applications – such as reliability, low-delay communication or security – to be dynamically tailored based on application demands, current network conditions, hardware capabilities or local policies, and also to support the integration of new network functionality in an evolutionary fashion, without applications having to be rewritten. This architectural change will make the Internet truly "enhanceable", by allowing applications to seamlessly and more easily take advantage of new network features as they evolve. This package contains the shared library for the NEAT APIs libraries and example programs. See https://www.neat-project.org for details on NEAT!'
